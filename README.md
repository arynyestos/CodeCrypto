# CodeCrypto
Repository containing all the work done throughout the CodeCrypto program. This repo's purpose is to back up the work done, not to showcase it. The CodeCryptoProjects repo —to which only the final versions of the projects developed during the course, but not all the practical exercises done to learn the theory, were uploaded— serves that purpose.
